# ðŸ§ª MolecularSoup

**MolecularSoup** is a browser-based simulation written in **TypeScript** that explores the fundamentals of **artificial chemistry (AChem)** â€” a field concerned with how life-like and self-organising behaviors can emerge from simple, rule-based interactions.

This project simulates a "digital soup" of abstract molecules that move, collide, and eventually react â€” serving as a foundation for studying emergence, self-replication, and autocatalysis.

## ðŸ§© Overview

In **MolecularSoup**, each molecule is represented as a symbolic structure (e.g. `"A"`, `"B"`, `"AB"`) moving through a virtual environment. Over time, molecules:
- Move randomly in 2D space.
- Bounce off boundaries and one another.
- (In later versions) React and form new compounds.

The simulation visualises this process using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element, allowing an intuitive, interactive way to observe the evolution of simple artificial chemical systems.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

The goal of MolecularSoup is to create a minimal, extensible framework for **exploring emergent behavior** in artificial systems.  
Long-term ambitions include:
- Modeling **autocatalytic networks**.
- Simulating **energy flow** and **reaction thermodynamics**.
- Investigating **self-replicating molecules**.
- Connecting to ideas in **origins-of-life** and **artificial life (ALife)** research.
